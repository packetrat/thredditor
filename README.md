# thredditor
A tool for editing social posts for threading. Working but work in progress.

This is a JavaScript-based tool for creating social media posts. The current version has a 280-character limit. This helps in taking pre-written material and dividing it into threads or editing to fit within the limits of a single post.

Future versions will write post contents to a threaded output that can be saved, cut and pasted into a social media platform, etc. A stretch goal would be to implement an API for integration with specific platforms.
